Plotting
========

Starting from v0.6.0, there is now a function ``rampy.plot_spectrum`` to plot a spectrum with Plotly. It is a simple function that takes as input the X and Y values of a spectrum and plot it. It can also take as input the baselines and smoothed signals to plot them too. Have a look at the :ref:`RST Notebooks` for further example of use.
