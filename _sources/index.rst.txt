The Rampy project
-----------------

Rampy is a Python library that aims at helping processing spectroscopic data, such as Raman, Infrared or XAS spectra.
It offers, for instance, functions to subtract baselines as well as to stack, resample or smooth spectra.
It aims at facilitating the use of Python in processing spectroscopic data.

The project is hosted on Github (`here! <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy>`_), please do not hesitate to propose new features or simply ideas!

Integration with other packages
-------------------------------

Rampy integrates within a workflow that uses Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib as well as optimisation libraries such as lmfit, emcee, PyMC3 for instance.

Rampy can be used also to analyse the output of the `RADIS <https://radis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package. See the discussion about this `here <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/issues/13>`_

For more advanced baseline algorithms, please also check the `Pybaselines package <https://pybaselines.readthedocs.io/>`_.
