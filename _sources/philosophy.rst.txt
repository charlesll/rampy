Philosophy
============

RamPy is created from a set of functions I use everyday to treat various kind of spectroscopic data in Python,
including Raman, infrared, XANES or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectra.

It aims at working jointly with matplotlib, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, ..., and thus to offer functions that can be easily included in a
"traditional" scientific python workflow.

It is an open source, free software library.
