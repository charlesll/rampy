Maps
====

Rampy offers the possiblity to analyse maps from Raman spectrometers using the ``rampy.maps`` module.

Line and 2D Maps saved in CSV or TXT format from Horiba and Renishaw spectrometers can be loaded, and various data treatments can be performed afterwards.

Below you will find the documentation of the ``rampy.maps`` module, and have a look at the example notebooks too for further examples of use: :ref:`RST Notebooks`

.. autoclass:: rampy.maps
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

The following functions are also available and used in the ``rampy.maps`` class to load spectra from different spectrometers.

.. autofunction:: rampy.read_renishaw
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

.. autofunction:: rampy.read_horiba
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
