Examples
========

For complete examples of use, please directly see the `example Jupyter notebooks here <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/tree/master/examples>`_

Below, some quick examples are shown to highlight some of the possibilities offered by Rampy

Library importation
-------------------
This is done with the usual Python way. A useful shortname for rampy is ``rp``:

.. code-block:: python

  # importing rampy
  import rampy as rp
  # and for numpy we will respect the usual name:
  import numpy as np
  # for matplotlib
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Data importation
----------------

This is done using directly Pandas or numpy, except for maps for which rampy provides a function to import the CSV files generated by
the Renishaw or Horiba Raman spectrometers.

To import a spectrum saved in a 2 column text file "data.txt" with space separator, we can use the numpy genfromtxt function:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np
  spectrum = np.genfromtxt("data.txt")

If our file has a 10 line header, we can skip it like

.. code-block:: python

  spectrum = np.genfromtxt("data.txt", skip_header=10)

See the documentation of numpy for further details, as well as that of Pandas.

Plot a spectrum
---------------

This can be done with Matplotlib directly. For instance, to plot our spectrum we can do:

.. code-block:: python

  plt.figure(figsize=(5,5))
  plt.plot(spectrum[:,0],spectrum[:,1],'k.',markersize=1)
  plt.xlabel("Raman shift, cm$^{-1}$", fontsize = 12)
  plt.ylabel("Normalized intensity, a. u.", fontsize = 12)
  plt.title("Fig. 1: the raw data",fontsize = 12,fontweight="bold")

This will give the image:

.. image:: ./images/spectrum.png
  :width: 400

Flipping
--------

Some spectra come with decreasing X values. Rampy offers a simple function to flip them. This can be necessary to resample them (as interpolation algorithms usually require the X values to increase). Here for our spectrum we can do:

.. code-block:: python

  spectrum_increasing = rp.flipsp(spectrum)

Resampling
----------

We need sometime to resample a spectrum with a new X axis. ``rampy.resample()`` offers such ability. For instance,
we have a spectrum that has a X axis from 400 to 1300 cm-1, with points each 0.9 cm-1. We want the same but with an X axis with a value each cm-1. We can do for our spectrum:

.. code-block:: python

  x_new = np.arange(400., 1300., 1.0) # we generate the new X values with numpy.arange()
  y_new = rp.resample(spectrum[:,0], spectrum[:,1], x_new)

Sometime, this can fail because we have a new X point at higher or lower values than the original X axis.
This is simply solved by asking ``rampy.resample()`` to extrapolate:

.. code-block:: python

  x_new = np.arange(400., 1300., 1.0) # we generate the new X values with numpy.arange()
  y_new = rp.resample(spectrum[:,0], spectrum[:,1], x_new, fill_value="extrapolate")

``rampy.resample`` uses ``scipy.interpolate.interp1d``. It can takes all the arguments that the latter function takes, so see its `doc <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html>`_ for details!

We can eventually create a new array with the x_new and y_new like:

.. code-block:: python

  spectrum_resample = np.vstack((x_new,y_new)).T

Normalisation
-------------

Rampy provides the ``rampy.normalisation()`` function to normalise the Y values of a spectrum to

- the maximum intensity
- the trapezoidal area under the curve
- to min-max values of intensities

See the `notebook on Github for examples <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Normalisation.ipynb>`_

Smoothing
---------

Rampy provides the ``rampy.smooth()`` function to smooth a spectrum. 10 different algorithms are available, see the `notebook on Github <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Smoothing.ipynb>`_ for examples of use.

Baseline
--------

Rampy allows you to fit polynomial, spline, generalized cross-validated spline, logarithms, exponential, ALS, arPLS, drPLS and rubberband baselines to your spectra, in order to remove the background.

See `this notebook <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/baseline_fit.ipynb>`_ for an example of use, and the help of ``rampy.baseline()`` for details on each algorithm.

Peak fitting
------------

Rampy does not provide functions for peak fitting yet. However, it integrates well with lmfit for instance. See `this notebook <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Raman_spectrum_fitting.ipynb>`_ for an example of use. We will upload soon an example of Bayesian peak fitting with a function integrated to rampy.

Machine learning
----------------

Rampy offers three classes for performing classification, regression or unsupervised ML exploration of a set of spectra. Those are helpful ways to automatically perform usual scalling, test-train splitting and ML training of popular ML algorithms, and use `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ in the background.

 - ``rampy.mlexplorer`` allows performing PCA and NMF at the moment. This is a work in progress. See the `example notebook <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Machine%20Learning%20Exploration.ipynb>`_.
 - ``rampy.regressor`` allows linking variations in spectra to some known variations like the composition of a sample. See the `example notebook <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Machine%20Learning%20Regression.ipynb>`_.
 - ``rampy.classificator`` allows automatic recognition of substances/stuffs from spectra. See the `example notebook here <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/MachineLearning_Classification.ipynb>`_.

Those functions work (``rp.regressor`` was used in `this publication <https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2019-6887>`_) but still may evolve in the futur. For advanced, ML, I suggest using directly scikit-learn or other ML libraries.

Do not hesitate to ask for new features depending on your needs !

Linear mixture
--------------

If you have two endmember spectra, you can use the ``rampy.mixing()`` function. See the `mixing example notebook here <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Mixing_spectra.ipynb>`_.

If you do not know the endmember spectra, then you may be interested in using directly the PyMCR library, see the documentation `here <https://pages.nist.gov/pyMCR/>`_ and an example notebook `here <https://github.com/usnistgov/pyMCR/blob/master/Examples/Demo.ipynb>`_. We used it in `this publication <https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2019-6887>`_, see the code `here <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Iron_AmMin_paper/Iron_MORB_code.ipynb>`_.
